                        settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other
                        technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
                        address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access

                accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>
            <p class="body">We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the
                European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our
                group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to
                protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with
                European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon

            <p class="body">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
                will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
                personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal

            <p class="body">In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK),
                and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information.
                You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
            <p class="body">In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable
                data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your
                personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
                personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may
                also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.</p>
            <p class="body">We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection
                laws.</p>
            <p class="body">If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your
                personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority
                or UK data protection authority.</p>
            <p class="body">If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and
                Information Commissioner.</p>
            <p class="body">Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
                information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the
                right to withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
            <p class="body">However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
                withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information
                conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
            <p class="body">Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our
                marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails
                that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section “How can you contact us
                about this notice?” below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still
                communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the
                administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing
                purposes.</p>

            <p class="body">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
                standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently
                respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
                be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we
                will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
